    <p class="vision__tall-copy u-grid-20 u-grid-center">On April 22, 2017, hundreds of thousands people showed up in more than 600 cities around the world to march for science, championing the role of science in supporting the common good and defending its role in society and policy.</p>

    <p class="vision__tall-copy u-grid-20 u-grid-center">People gathered on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/22/us/marchforscience-antarctica-trnd/">all seven continents</a>, the <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/blog/2017/4/21/march-for-science-north-pole-edition">North Pole</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceMarchHI/status/855894772082294784">the bottom of the ocean</a>. </p>

  </h1>

  <p class="u-text-h4 u-text-normal" style="margin: 28px 0">So, what’s next?</p>

  <p class="u-text-h5 u-text-normal u-grid-20 u-grid-center">We are reviewing what we have learned so far and consulting with our partners, satellite march leaders, and supporters to develop next steps for each of these goals. We are tapping into the wealth of existing knowledge on these subjects to guide us as we move forward. We are building the foundation required to ensure that this march was not only a powerful moment of support for science, but the start of a movement.</p>
{{!--
  <p class="u-text-h4 u-text-normal" style="margin: 24px 0;" >In service of this vision, we are building the team, network, and infrastructure to support the following:</p>

  <div class="u-grid-12 u-text-left vision__quad-section">
    <h4 class="u-text-orange u-text-bold u-text-uppercase">Global Network</h4>
    <p><b>Creating an international coaltiion working together to improve the relationship between science and society</b></p>
    <p>We have an opportunity to coordinate our efforts like never before. By providing infrastructure to support Satellite chapters of March for Science across the world, we can stay connected to our local communitie and to each other. Organizing and sustaining this network will provide long-term opportunities for collective impact.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="u-grid-12 u-grid-last u-text-left vision__quad-section">
    <h4 class="u-text-orange u-text-bold u-text-uppercase">Resource Hub</h4>
    <p><b>Maintaining a library of best practices, toolkits, and resources to support change agents everywhere</b></p>
    <p>Nobody in this network should have to start at square one when implementing educational programs, organizing community e orts, or handling administrative needs. By synthesizing and sharing our knowledge and resources, we can streamline logistics to focus on the important work to be done locally and nationally.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="u-grid-12 u-text-left vision__quad-section">
    <h4 class="u-text-orange u-text-bold u-text-uppercase">Collaborative Programs</h4>
    <p><b>Working with partner organizations to create, extend, and promote high impact programs</b></p>
    <p>The best way to make progress is by working together and complementing each other's strengths. We will identify promising programs created by partner organizations to either co-develop, scale and disseminate, or cra  resources inspired by a particular program. By starting at the edge of what's already being done well, we can create more opportunities for real change.</p>

  <div class="u-grid-12 u-grid-last u-text-left vision__quad-section">
    <h4 class="u-text-orange u-text-bold u-text-uppercase">Original Programs</h4>
    <p><b>Identifying gaps and developing innovative programs in support of our mission</b></p>
    <p>By paying attention to what works well and considering bold ideas from across our teams, we will design novel programs that can be distributed broadly. Our programs will emphasize building bridges and tools that can be tailored to both national needs and the unique needs of the local communities our network comprises.</p>

<h2 class="vision__block-header vision__block-header--teal">Our Pillars</h2>

<section class="vision__section u-grid-container u-text-center">
  <h2 class="u-text-teal u-text-h5 u-grid-20 u-grid-center">We have a lot of work to do. By focusing our energy on these three key and complementary areas, we can tackle both the most urgent needs and address the mechanisms that will make the biggest difference in the long run.</h2>

  <div class="vision__pillar u-grid-8">
    <h3 class="vision__pillar-headline u-text-capital">Policy <span>& Advocacy</span></h3>
    <h4 class="vision__piller-description u-text-h6 u-text-capital u-color-gray5">Activate existing science advocates by facilitating access to skills and resources for effecting change.</h4>

    <h5 class="vision__piller-subhead">Goals</h5>
    <ul class="vision__piller-goals">
      <li>Activism</li>
      <li>Civic Literacy</li>
      <li>Political Engagement</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="vision__piller-subhead">Audience</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Allies who want to effect political or legislative change.</li>
      <li>Citizens who want to understand science's role in policy/government.</li>
      <li>Scientists who want to get into local or national politics.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5 class="vision__piller-subhead">Summary</h5>
    <p class="vision__piller-summary u-grid-center u-text-left">Evidence-based policy must be prioritized and protected. In support of this goal, individuals must be informed, coordinated and prepared to act. In addition to providing immediate calls to action, educating about civic literacy and the current state of science in policy is euqally important. To this end, we will spearhead projects that leverage scientific insights and strategies for e ecting change through political movements as well as promoting specific action items that address salient or threatened issues.</p>

      <li>Citizens who want to know what's going in their community.</li>
      <li>Scientists who want to give back to their communities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5 class="vision__piller-subhead">Summary</h5>
    <p class="vision__piller-summary u-grid-center u-text-left">The 400+ satellite Marches happening internationally provide an incredible opportunity to empower communities. By creating infrastructure to support community action and engagement, we can give city-based Action Teams a solid foundation to build upon. It is critical to prioritize training, supporting, and maintaining Action Teams in each region/city while supporting the further development of complementary projects that improve communications and coordination between cities and siloes.</p>

    </ol>

    <h5 class="vision__piller-subhead">Summary</h5>
    <p class="vision__piller-summary u-grid-center u-text-left">Lack of education, access, and inclusive messaging are underlying mechanisms that perpetuate many of the issues we face. By identifying, nurturing, and distributing promising educational projects, we can channel momentum into action items that stand to have a long-term impact on progress. Addressing urgent policy issues is crucial. However, by considering the factors that e ect cultural norms, attitudes, and behaviors, we can simultaneously work towards building a more informed and effective society in the future.</p>
